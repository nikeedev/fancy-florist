# **GameEngine.js**: A 2D game engine made for using HTML Canvas!
![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@nikee_dev/gameengine_js?color=Green&label=Current%20package%20version&style=flat-square)

## **The engine is still under development!**

### Quick Setup and Start:

Desire your choice of downloading the engine, either using npm or trough GitHub, but i will use npm


<br>
Choose your location where you want to start your game and use

`npm init`
 to initialize your folder for npm.
 Next, use `npm install @nikeedev/gameengine_js` to install the engine.

 Then create all needed files for your web game, like a HTML file and a main JavaScript file. 

Import the engine using this line of code: `import { GameEngine } from '/path/to/GameEngine.js'`. Use `GameEngine` to gather the engine, and its classes and functions. You can also manually write classes and variables you want to import, instead of having all of them in `GameEngine` variable. Use this way if you prefer so: `import { Rect, Vector2, version, about } from '/path/to/GameEngine.js'`

Now your ready for coding!

### Examples:
**All examples to current features are available on examples folder (GitHub), or on** https://nikeedev.github.io/GameEngine_js

### Features:

**A game engine making website games that implements Canvas API, and has many useful functions and classes. Will be added more functions and features further!**

**Classes:**
 - ```ts 
    var name = new GameEngine.Graphics.Rect(position: Vector2, size: Size, screenSize: Size);
   ```
   - Rect class draws you a rectangle into the canvas, you can change its position, size, and current screen size( for it to work )

<br>

- ```ts 
   var name = new GameEngine.Graphics.Text(text: string, position: Vector2, screenSize: Size);
  ```
  - Text class draws you a text block into the canvas, you can change its text, position and current screen size( for it to work )

<br>

- ```ts
   var name = new GameEngine.Vector2(x: number, y: number);
  ```
  - Vector2 class for position for other classes. Can be used without the drawing classes.
  
<br>

- ```ts
   var name = new GameEngine.Size(width: number, height: number);
  ```
  - Size class for sizing numbers for other classes. Can be used without the drawing classes.
  
<br> 

- ```ts
   var name = new GameEngine.Graphics.Sprite(imageSrc: string, position: Vector2, ScreenSize: Size);
  ```
  - Sprite class draws a sprite/image into canvas, you can change its source location of image, position and current screen size( for it to work ). You must first initialize sprite, before you can draw it.
  
<br>

- ```ts
   var name = new GameEngine.Display(CanvasSize: Size);
  ```
  - Display class makes it easy to start coding with GameEngine.js, it create you manually a \<canvas\> element, and also gathers from it 2D context, to make the GameEngine.js draw. After calling the class with `var name = new Display(new Size(200, 200));`. You will need to initialize the screen, so it will use your custom size to create the canvas element with the context.

<br>

- ```ts
   var name = new GameEngine.Sound();
  ```
  - Sound class makes it easy to play audio on your app/game!
